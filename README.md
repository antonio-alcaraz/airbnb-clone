  - Before starting a new turn, you have the option to finish the game, terminate the program and output the current scores of the two players

- Tech
  - Use a dotnet core project, you may need to install a few .Net Core SDK
  - Don't Dockerize you app yet
  - You may add some tests (10 will be ok) for your hardest logic, this will help us later to setup github actions and see the proper CI workflow
