[![.NET Core Build with Tests](https://github.com/rescodeio/poker-game/actions/workflows/dotnet-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rescodeio/poker-game/actions/workflows/dotnet-tests.yml)

## Code Challenges

- Tech
  - Use a dotnet core project, you may need to install a few .Net Core SDK
  - Don't Dockerize you app yet
  - You may add some tests (10 will be ok) for your hardest logic, this will help us later to setup github actions and see the proper CI workflow
